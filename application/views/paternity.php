		This is symptomatic of a wider problem with how we talk about equality in society. In a report, published earlier this year, MPs on the Women and Equalities Committee recommended an overhaul of paternity leave after statistics suggested that as few as 1% of UK fathers are taking what leave they are entitled to. This is in spite of significant numbers wanting to take a more active role.

<br><br>This discrepancy is due to a range of factors, including fathers being unable to afford leave, and stereotypes and workplace attitudes which make men unable, or uncomfortable to ask for it. Fathers report similar marginalisation and belittling in other activities they do as parents – including at schools, nurseries and healthcare services. Almost as though to prove the point, the committee’s report itself slips into referring to fathers as “second parents”.

<br><br>This means that men are currently missing out. Research shows that there are a range of benefits of fathers taking on greater childcare responsibilities: beyond the obvious benefits to child development, it can also improve the mental health and fulfilment of men. This has a knock-on impact on men’s physical health. Involved fathers are less likely to suffer from accidental or premature death, hospital admissions, and substance abuse.

                <h3>New parents to get two weeks’ paid leave in this year’s budget</h3>

		The Government plans to introduce two weeks’ paid parental leave in this year’s budget and will aim to increase it every year for the next number of years.

Ministers have also agreed a longer time period in which parents can avail of the leave, and are considering measures to force fathers to take time off after a child’s birth.

<br><br>The Cabinet sub-committee on social policy, chaired by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and attended by 10 Cabinet Ministers, considered the issue at a meeting last week.

It decided against increasing paid maternity benefit, which stands at 26 weeks, or paternity benefit, which is currently two weeks, at this juncture.

Instead there will be a focus on introducing a paid parental scheme, which would be available to both parents and would reach 18 weeks over a period of time.

<br><br>Ireland is one of only six EU countries where employers are not obliged to pay workers if they take parental leave. It is currently at the discretion of the employer.

Parents can currently avail of over four months (18 weeks) unpaid parental leave before the child is eight years old.

Ministers also agreed to examine increasing the time period in which this benefit can be accessed to 12 years old.
