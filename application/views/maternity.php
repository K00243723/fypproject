              <h3>Most women give birth in hospital</h3>

        <p>    
 NHS maternity services are stretched and infant mortality rates in the UK are some of the worst in Europe. At last count, as many as 97.9% of births took place in hospital – despite the fact that hospital births aren’t always safer. Actually, the reason why the vast majority of women give birth in hospital has more to do with history, than with health outcomes.

<br><br>During the early decades of the 20th century, the state was highly focused on making sure children survived into adulthood, as the national birth rate had been declining since 1918. Funding was ploughed into maternity and child services, to give children the best start. At the outbreak of World War II, preparations began to evacuate pregnant women close to giving birth to emergency maternity hospitals in the countryside, for their confinement.

<br><br>Until this time, most women gave birth at home, usually with the assistance of a midwife. But this became much more difficult during the war, as midwifery services had been moved to the emergency hospitals outside the UK’s major cities. Today, research tells us that home births are often a safer option than hospital births. But while the NHS are trying to encourage women to consider home birth as an option, it’s proving hard to kick the nation’s habit of going to hospital.
